# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Around 3 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Refactoring the code for the new changes
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
See above. I picked new item type because it is interesting how to scale the app. And I picked delete multiple items because I wanted to use a method that can receive any number of arguments of the same type.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Refactoring and learning more gems
